    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Derrick and I'm a former premed now interested in <br> 
        becoming a founder in the healthtech space. I love reading about <br> 
        the greats, learning how to learn, startups, entrepreneurship, <br> 
        and life philosophy. I play competitive badminton occasionally <br> 
        and my aim in life is to produce more than I consume. <br> 
    </p>

    <h2>Writings</h2>
    <p>
        I've found that writing is a great way to learn because you don't really <br>
        know what you do or don't know until you've wrote it out. Please <br>
        check out my writing <a href="writings.html">here! </a>
    </p>
