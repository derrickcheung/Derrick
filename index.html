    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Derrick and I'm a former premed now interested in <br> 
        becoming a founder in the healthtech space. I love reading about <br> 
        the greats and interesting topics, learning how to learn, startups, <br> 
        and life philosophy. I play competitive badminton occasionally <br> 
        and my aim in life is to produce more than I consume. <br> 
    </p>

    <h2>Writings</h2>
    <p>
        I've found that writing is a great way to learn because you don't really <br>
        know what you do or don't know until you've wrote it out. Please <br>
        check out my writing <a href="writings.html">here! </a>
    </p>

    <h2>Random</h2>
    <p>funny <a href="jackmeme.html">meme</a> I made </p>
    <p>some <a href="./principles.html">principles</a> that require more thought</p>
